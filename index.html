    <h2>Uses of JavaScript</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Web Development</h3>
    <p>
      Web development encompasses the creation of websites and web applications.
      It involves front-end development for user interfaces and back-end
      development for server-side functionality. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are
      fundamental languages, while frameworks and tools enhance efficiency and
      interactivity.
    </p>
    <h3>Web Applications</h3>
    <p>
      Web applications are software programs accessible via web browsers. They
      provide various services and functionalities, including online shopping,
      social media, and productivity tools. They rely on technologies like HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction and data processing.
    </p>
    <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript is essential for front-end web development. It enables the
      creation of interactive user interfaces, form validation, and the
      manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) to update the content and
      structure of web pages dynamically.
    </p>
    <h3>Server Applications</h3>
    <p>
      Server applications in JavaScript, using platforms like Node.js, leverage
      its event-driven, non-blocking architecture. They manage network requests,
      perform data processing, and enable real-time communication, making
      JavaScript a versatile choice for building scalable and efficient
      server-side solutions.
    </p>
    <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript is primarily a client-side language, it can also be used for
      server-side development using platforms like Node.js. Node.js allows
      developers to build scalable and high-performance server applications
      using JavaScript, making it possible to use the same language for both
      front-end and back-end development.
    </p>
    <h3>Games</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript is used to create web-based games, from simple puzzles to
      complex 3D adventures. Libraries like Phaser and Three.js facilitate game
      development, making it accessible and interactive for users in web
      browsers.
    </p>
    <h2>JavaScript Engines</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>V8</h3>
    <p>
      V8 is a JavaScript engine developed by the Chromium Project for Google
      Chrome and Chromium web browsers. It is a JavaScript engine that can run
      standalone, or be embedded into any C++ application. Using its own parser,
      it generates an abstract syntax tree. Then, Ignition generates bytecode
      from this syntax tree using the internal V8 bytecode format. Bytecode is
      compiled into machine code by TurboFan. It also handles memory allocation
      for objects, and garbage collects objects it no longer needs. Optimization
      techniques such as elision of expensive runtime properties, and inline
      caching. The garbage collector is a generational incremental collector.
    </p>
    <h3>Chakra</h3>
    <p>
      Chakra is a JScript engine developed by Microsoft. It is proprietary
      software. It is used in the Internet Explorer web browser. A distinctive
      feature of the engine is that it JIT compiles scripts on a separate CPU
      core, parallel to the web browser.
    </p>
    <h3>Spider Monkey</h3>
    <p>
      SpiderMonkey is the first JavaScript engine, written by Brendan Eich at
      Netscape Communications, later released as open-source and currently
      maintained by the Mozilla Foundation. It is still used in the Firefox web
      browser.
    </p>
    <h2>Event Loop Mechanism</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Call Stack</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript has a call stack where function execution is managed in a
      Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order.
    </p>
    <h3>Web APIs (or Background Tasks)</h3>
    <p>
      These include setTimeout, setInterval, fetch, DOM events, and other
      non-blocking operations.
    </p>
    <h3>Callback Queue (Task Queue)</h3>
    <p>
      When an asynchronous operation is completed, its callback is pushed into
      the task queue.
    </p>
    <h3>Event Loop</h3>
    <p>
      It continuously checks the call stack and, if empty, moves tasks from the
      queue to the stack for execution.
